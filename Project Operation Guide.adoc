= Organizational Vision and Operational Guide for the C++ Alliance

I am writing to provide a brief elucidation on the organizational vision and operational guide for the C++ Alliance, specifically in regards to our hiring processes and work models.

Our primary objective is to preserve a high standard of excellence in the Alliance by employing only the most competent personnel. Each staff engineer we bring onboard is meant to epitomize the pinnacle of expertise in their field. We place a strong emphasis on hiring experienced individuals, capable of operating autonomously, demonstrating self-motivation, and assuming leadership roles in managing projects.

Nevertheless, we recognize the importance of offering initial guidance to our newly onboarded staff. The orientation process will encompass the use and location of our assets and resources, an introduction to our communication tools, roles and responsibilities within the team, and identification of go-to personnel for assistance.

Our hiring approach is grounded in two distinct work models. The first model accommodates highly skilled individuals who have already initiated remarkable open-source projects and wish to continue working on them full-time, while also maintaining financial stability. This model minimizes administrative overhead as these individuals come prepared with a well-defined work product.

In the second model, we identify prospective projects and corresponding candidates who are a suitable match. For instance, our potential projects like 'nudb / append-only index library' would fall into this category. Here, the new hire requires a liaison within the organization to communicate project requirements, define the project vision, and assist with directional decisions when necessary.

However, it is crucial to acknowledge that our current management model—where multiple individuals rely on a single point of contact for their queries—is not scalable. It becomes increasingly challenging as the organization expands.

We are actively exploring strategies to streamline these operations to ensure a more effective and scalable model for project management. More details will follow as we formalize this process.
