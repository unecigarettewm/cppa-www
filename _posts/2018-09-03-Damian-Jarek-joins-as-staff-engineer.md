Damian Jarek joins the Alliance as Staff Engineer. Previously he worked on a
number of embedded networking projects for a few major clients. As a Staff
Engineer he’ll be working on an open-source companion library for Boost.Beast
and Boost.Asio, which will abstract away the platform-specific details of
acessing system proxy settings and performing TLS verification of a peer
certificate chain using the operating system’s key store.
