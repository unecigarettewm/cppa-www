This week I got the opportunity to chat with Rob and Jason about the
[open letters](https://github.com/grafikrobot/cpp_scope) to the C++ committee
I wrote on [CppCast](https://cppcast.com/standard-tooling-debugging/).
The letters propose to expand the scope of the C++ standards work to include
the ecosystem of tools and related technologies.
