Over the last few months I have been mainly working on boost.async and getting it ready review - twice.
It had two review periods (August, with too low a turnout) and one in late September which it passed conditionally.

The time between both review periods gave me time to improve the library based on the feedback of the first.

One of the conditions was a new name, so it's `cobalt` instead of `async` now and will be included in boost.

Additionally, I've been busy with training colleagues, beast & process maintenance work and invested some time into refactoring boost.requests.
