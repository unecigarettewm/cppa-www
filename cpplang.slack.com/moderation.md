CppLang Slack Moderation Guidelines
===================================

Introduction
------------

It is important that all usersâ€™ questions, answers and comments are in line with the [CppLang Slack Code of Conduct]({{site.baseurl}}/), as well as with the category and topic, or channel, they belong to. When deciding to approach a user, moderators and administrators must always assume intentions are good, which is usually the case. Over-moderation is harmful to the atmosphere of the community and should be avoided.

Expectations for moderator enforcement
--------------------------------------

While in practice most actions from moderators and administrators will be friendly reminders, they should act on complaints/reports quickly and involve other team members if necessary. They should take appropriate, usually private, action if they see any abuse or harassment. They must be sensitive to cultural differences, time zones, etc., but take prompt action when necessary. A moderator is one who exists to serve the community.

Suggested strategies for moderators when dealing with observed violations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderators will use their judgement to decide how to respond to a violation to the Code of Conduct.

- For very minor infractions, a small public message saying the discussion is getting out of hand may be enough. All users, admin or not, are encouraged to do so if they are comfortable with it.
- In other cases it may be better to contact the person or people responsible for the violation privately. This action should be left to moderators only.
- In cases of obvious, flagrant violations, moderators will remove the post immediately, and bring the issue to the attention of the private #admins channel.
