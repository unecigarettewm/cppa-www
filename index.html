        Empowering The C++ Community
        </p>
        <p>
        Mankind is reliant on software, for all aspects of life. Software is the
        foundation of commerce, industry, recreation, transportation, communication,
        and more. The best software solutions are written using the C++ programming
        language.
        </p>
        <p>
        The C++ Alliance (a California non-profit 501(c)(3)-pending organization)
        recognizes that great programs have yet to be developed due to a lack of
        required resources. As a result we stand behind “open source." Through open
        source libraries, the original code is available to be redistributed and
        modified without restrictions. This allows for better collaboration among
        programmers. Our primary function is to advance the development of open
        source software. It is our mission to empower programmers.
        </p>
        <p> 
        We intend to build a better programming environment. The Alliance envisions
        support for the creation and distribution of open source libraries, achieved
        by developing, communicating and promoting the best programming practices.
        It is our desire to support the creation and use of better standards and tools
        for when working with source code.  
        </p>
        <p>
        The Alliance supports individuals and organizations with similar goals by: 
        </p>
        <ul><li>
            Employing "staff engineers" to write code, produce tools, and advance
            the interests of the C++ community.
        </li><li>
            Provide travel grants for industry professionals to attend events,
            including ISO Standards Committee meetings, conferences, or other
            relevant gatherings.
        </li><li>
            Offering incentives or bounties to individuals or groups for achieving
            goals in alignment with the mission.
        <li>
            Selectively sponsoring other organizations with overlapping objectives.
        </li></ul>
        <p>
        We are dedicated to helping the C++ programming language evolve. We see
        it developing as an ecosystem of open source libraries and as a growing
        community of those who contribute to those libraries.

        Given the existence of Standard C++ Foundation and Software Freedom
        Conservancy, why was it necessary to form The C++ Alliance as a new,
        separate legal entity?
        </p><p>
        Although the missions of Standard C++ Foundation and The C++ Alliance
        are similar and overlapping, they have different status under tax law.
        The Foundation is organized as a 501(c)(6) organization, a trade group.
        In addition to providing legal protection for companies to work together
        in ways that might otherwise be viewed as industrial "collusion," a
        trade group can accept tax-deductible dues from member companies. The
        Alliance is organized as a 501(c)(3) organization, a charity which can
        accept tax deductible contributes from the general public.
        </p><p>
        Although the tax status of Software Freedom Conservancy and The C++
        Alliance are similar, their missions and concerns are different. There
        is mission overlap. Conservancy, whose mission is to support the
        development of FLOSS libraries supports the Boost Libraries project,
        which would also be within the mission of The Alliance, but The Alliance
        has both a narrower and a broader mission. While Conservancy is language
        agnostic and is focused on software development, The Alliance is focused
        exclusively on the C++ environment and is free to support non-FLOSS
        projects such as language proposals, books, education materials, tools,
        or other projects which may not be software or may have non-FLOSS
        licensing.
        </p><p>
        It is also the case that The C++ Alliance is not a good fit as a
        Conservancy project. It is appropriate for small open-source projects
        to pool their resources to provide themselves with financial, legal,
        accounting, and other services for which they have a common need and for
        which they may, individually, be too small to economically procure.
        Although the Alliance will be promoting library development, it doesn't
        have the same requirements as a FLOSS software producer, so would need
        different services than your typical Conservancy project and has
        sufficient endowment to fund the services that it will require.
