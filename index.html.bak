<h1>Mission</h1>

<h2>Empowering The C++ Community</h2>

<p>
Mankind is reliant on software, for all aspects of life. Software is the
foundation of commerce, industry, recreation, transportation, communication,
and more. The best software solutions are written using the C++ programming
language.
</p>
<p>
The C++ Alliance (a California non-profit 501(c)(3)-pending organization)
recognizes that great programs have yet to be developed due to a lack of
required resources. As a result we stand behind “open source." Through open
source libraries, the original code is available to be redistributed and
modified without restrictions. This allows for better collaboration among
programmers. Our primary function is to advance the development of open
source software. It is our mission to empower programmers.
</p>
<p> 
We intend to build a better programming environment. The Alliance envisions
support for the creation and distribution of open source libraries, achieved
by developing, communicating and promoting the best programming practices.
It is our desire to support the creation and use of better standards and tools
for when working with source code.  
</p>
<p>
The Alliance supports individuals and organizations with similar goals by: 
</p>
<ul><li>
    Employing "staff engineers" to write code, produce tools, and advance
    the interests of the C++ community.
</li><li>
    Provide travel grants for industry professionals to attend events,
    including ISO Standards Committee meetings, conferences, or other
    relevant gatherings.
</li><li>
    Offering incentives or bounties to individuals or groups for achieving
    goals in alignment with the mission.
<li>
    Selectively sponsoring other organizations with overlapping objectives.
</li></ul>
<p>
We are dedicated to helping the C++ programming language evolve. We see
it developing as an ecosystem of open source libraries and as a growing
community of those who contribute to those libraries.

<h1>FAQ</h1>

<ul>

<li><p><b>Given the existence of Standard C++ Foundation and Software Freedom
    Conservancy, why was it necessary to form The C++ Alliance as a new,
    separate legal entity?
    </b></p><p>
    Although the missions of Standard C++ Foundation and The C++ Alliance are
    similar and overlapping, they have different status under tax law. The
    Foundation is organized as a 501(c)(6) organization, a trade group. In
    addition to providing legal protection for companies to work together in
    ways that might otherwise be viewed as industrial "collusion," a trade
    group can accept tax-deductible dues from member companies. The Alliance
    is organized as a 501(c)(3) organization, a charity which can accept tax
    deductible contributes from the general public.
    </p><p>
    Although the tax status of Software Freedom Conservancy and The C++
    Alliance are similar, their missions and concerns are different. There
    is mission overlap. Conservancy, whose mission is to support the
    development of FLOSS libraries supports the Boost Libraries project,
    which would also be within the mission of The Alliance, but The Alliance
    has both a narrower and a broader mission. While Conservancy is language
    agnostic and is focused on software development, The Alliance is focused
    exclusively on the C++ environment and is free to support non-FLOSS
    projects such as language proposals, books, education materials, tools,
    or other projects which may not be software or may have non-FLOSS licensing.
    </p><p>
    It is also the case that The C++ Alliance is not a good fit as a
    Conservancy project. It is appropriate for small open-source projects
    to pool their resources to provide themselves with financial, legal,
    accounting, and other services for which they have a common need and
    for which they may, individually, be too small to economically procure.
    Although The Alliance will be promoting library development, it doesn't
    have the same requirements as a FLOSS software producer, so would need
    different services than your typical Conservancy project and has
    sufficient endowment to fund the services that it will require.
