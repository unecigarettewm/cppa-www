<p>Braden graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering, but soon pivoted to software after he spent way too much of his free time writing C++. Now he can do it for work *and* in his free time! Braden spends his days working on supply chain software, and spends his nights working on parser combinators and getting involved in the C++ community.</p>
