<p>
    Evan is a long-time XML geek. After presenting at the XSLT-UK conference in 2001, he joined the W3C XSL Working Group to help define XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0. Since then, he has written various books including XSLT 1.0 Pocket Reference and has helped a variety of clients meet their most challenging data transformation, publishing, and search application needs. His mission at the C++ Alliance is to create a state-of-the-art publishing framework for C++ documentation. When he's not writing code, Evan plays the piano, sings, meditates, writes about spirituality, cultivates intentional community, connects with people on Clubhouse, performs in plays, musicals, and ballets, does relationship coaching, and fathers his three mostly-grown children.
