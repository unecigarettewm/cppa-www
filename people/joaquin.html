<p>
    Joaquín is a telecommunications engineer freelancing in product/innovation/technological consultancy for telco, TV, and IoT. On the programming front, he caught the C++ virus 20+ years ago and hasn't shaken it off yet. Joaquín is the author of three Boost libraries (MultiIndex, Flyweight, PolyCollection) and has done some minor contributions to the standard such as N3657 (heterogeneous lookup). He's happy at the intersection of lib design, performance and maths.
