<p>Jon Kalb is a community organizer. He chairs CppCon, C++Now, the
Silicon Valley Code Camp C++ Track, and the Boost Steering Committee.
Jon does on-site C++ training for companies around the world and is
the author (with Ga&scaron;per AÅ¾man) of C++ Today: The Beast is Back.</p>

<p>He is a software engineering autodidact and has been programming
professionally since 1991. Over the last two decades, he has written
code for Amazon, Apple, Dow Chemical, Intuit, Lotus, Microsoft,
Netscape, Sun, Yahoo! and a number of companies that you've not heard
of.</p>

<p>Jon is best known for starting and running the world's largest C++
conference and won &ldquo;Best Tutorial&rdquo; for his talk on Exception-Safe
Code, so it isn't surprising that he has a passion for explaining C++
well.</p>

<p>One thing Jon wants to accomplish as a community organizer at
C++Alliance is to help other programmers reach their goals. He is good
at helping people figure out where they are and what they need to get
to where they want to be. He finds it useful in training and working
with exhibitors and conference sponsors.</p>
