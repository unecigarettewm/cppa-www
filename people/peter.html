<p>I have a BSc in Computer Science from Edinburgh University, and a PhD from Reading University, both in the UK. Earlier in my career, I wrote a number of computer games: Scrabble (assembler), Borodino, Waterloo, Austerlitz, Dreadnoughts wargames in C, then Battalia in C++ and Trireme Commander (a simulation) in C#. I find programming fun, especially algorithms, AI, simulation, graphics, audio, and games logic. More recently I have documented SDKs and written developer tutorials, including for Microsoft Flight Simulator, WorldWide Telescope (an astronomy program), and Azure IoT, Azure Search, and Azure Maps. Learning is fun too, which of course it has to be with so much to learn!</p>
