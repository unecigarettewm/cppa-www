<p>
    Seth Heeren has been programming since 1990, and C++ since
    taking a break from his Master's Musical Theory in 1998. That break proved to be indefinite, when it became clear that there was ample opportunity to develop his other self-taught interest: programming.
</p>

<p>
    Over the years he has realized that the real challenges in programming aren't with learning a specific language, but in applying tools effectively, going from coding to deployment and configuration management.
</p>

<p>
    In doing so, simplicity trumps cleverness, and experience often leads to more simplicity.
</p>

<p>
    In 2013 he embarked on a personal project to "learn Boost". The method was by answering questions on StackOverflow. After all, the quickest way to get expert input is **not** to ask a question, but to post the wrong answer.
</p>

<p>
    After a decade, Seth has become well-versed in many, and an inadvertant guru in some Boost libraries. He summarizes the experience in his mantra "The expert invariably means the person with the most patience".
</p>

<p>
    In April 2022 Seth joins the C++ Alliance to be more effective at removing barriers to entrance for people making similar journeys through C++ and Boost in particular.
