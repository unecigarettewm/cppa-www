Spencer is a software engineer with over 23 years of web development experience.  After creating his first personal website in 1996, he began his professional career in 1998, developing dynamic web applications the summer before his junior year in high school.  He has since worked on a wide variety of projects using a variety of programming languages, including C#, Python, PHP, ColdFusion, and JavaScript / Node.js.  He is also experienced in design, search engine optimization, and social media marketing. 

Some of his more recent projects include:

Developing front-end components in React.js and Svelte.js and helping to debug smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for a DeFi company in the web3 space

Developing machine learning software to analyze ultrasound scans and generate clinical reports, working with both doctors and patients, for a medical imaging start-up based in a private practice

Taking a mobile app for a major US law firm from discovery to launch and beyond, building versions for iPhone, Android, and the now-defunct Windows Phone

Spencer is a highly skilled and experienced software engineer with a passion for his work.  He is always looking for new challenges and is eager to learn new technologies.  He has an eye for detail and loves helping others find solutions to their problems.  Being completely self-taught and learning the basics of coding by age 8, he can bring a unique perspective when it comes to problem-solving.  While he enjoys all types of programming, front-end / user-facing web development is his favorite, due to being able to have a direct impact for end users and helping them complete their goals in the most efficient and pleasurable fashion.
