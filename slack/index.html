  <p>
  This is a multi-channel Slack workspace environment which gathers
  users of C++ from around the world into the same place so we can
  all learn from each other. It is like IRC but with modern clients
  that support multimedia, notifications, and smart devices.
  </p>
  <p>
    Choose one of the following to get started:

  <ul class="newsS">
    <li><a href="https://cpplang-inviter.cppalliance.org/" id="reglink" target="_new">I need an invitation to the C++ Slack workspace.</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://cpplang.slack.com">I already have a C++ Slack workspace account.</a></li>

  <ul>
  <li><p><b>Why do you need my e-mail?</b></p><p>
    Slack is invite based. Your e-mail address is used to register you
    in the workspace. The invitation tool does not store your address.
    </p></li>

  <li><p><b>Who operates this Slack workspace?</b></p><p>
    This workspace is paid for and operated in the public interest by
    The C++ Alliance in accordance with the mission to promote
    the general welfare of the C++ programming language.
    </p></li>

  <li><p><b>What are the rules?</b></p><p>
    Please remain professional in public channels. People from differing
    cultures and locales all meet here to discuss C++ topics.
    We ask that you follow the Acceptable Use Policy.
    </p></li>

  <li><p><b>How are the rules enforced?</b></p><p>
    Due to the sheer size of the community, it is not practical for
    admins to police every channel all the time. When you see a user
    acting poorly, consider letting them know in a nice way. Give a
    benefit of the doubt generously, as spirited debate is sometimes
    mistaken for bad behavior.</p><p>
    If diplomacy fails and disruptions persist, mentioning <b>@mods</b>
    in the channel will get the attention of the moderators. Or, you can
    contact an admin
    (<a href="https://cpplang.slack.com/account/workspace-settings#admins">list</a>)
    privately and explain the nature of the problem.
    </p></li>

  <ol>
  <li><p><b>Friendly, professional cooperation</b></p>
    <p><em>"First, do no harm."</em></p><p>
    Unlawful statements (including but not limited to credible threats,
    doxxing, cyber-bullying, stalking, or harassment) are prohibited
    in <em>all channels</em>.
    </p></li>
  <li><p><b>Safe for work</b></p><p>
    Please treat all public channels as Safe For Work (SFW). Don't say
    anything you wouldn't want a co-worker to see if they pass by your desk.
    </p></li>
  <li><p><b>On-topic discussion</b></p><p>
    In every public channel but especially the <b>#learn</b> channel
    which is the most heavily joined, please refrain from off-topic
    discussion. In public channels, avoid these topics altogether:
    politics, religion, race, gender, sex.
    </p></li>
  <li><p><b>No excessive self-promotion</b></p><p>
    A link to your project or news item is of course welcome in the
    <b>#plug_worthy</b> channel. However keep in mind that this
    community is not intended to be an advertising platform.
    </p></li>
  <li><p><b>Job offers</b></p><p>
    Job offers are welcomed in the <b>#jobs</b> channel, but please include
    the location, the company, a link to details and keep it in the relevant
    room.
    </p></li>
