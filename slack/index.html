<h2>C++ Language Slack Community</h2>
<p>
This is a multi-channel Slack workspace environment which gathers
users of C++ from around the world into the same place so we can
all learn from each other. It is like IRC but with modern clients
that support multimedia, notifications, and smart devices.

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Why do you need my e-mail?</b></p><p>
  Slack is invite based. Your e-mail address is used to register you
  in the workspace. The invitation tool does not store your address.
  </p></li>

<li><p><b>Who operates this Slack workspace?</b></p><p>
  This workspace is paid for and operated in the public interest by
  The C++ Alliance, Inc. in accordance with the mission to promote
  the general welfare of the C++ programming language.
  </p></li>

<li><p><b>What are the rules?</b></p><p>
  Please remain professional in public channels. People from differing
  cultures and locales all meet here to discuss C++ topics.
  We ask that you follow the Code of Conduct.
  </p></li>

<li><p><b>How are the rules enforced?</b></p><p>
  Due to the sheer size of the community, it is not practical for
  admins to police every channel all the time. When you see a user
  acting poorly, consider letting them know in a nice way. Give a
  benefit of the doubt generously, as spirited debate is sometimes
  mistaken for bad behavior.</p><p>
  If diplomacy fails and disruptions persist, please contact
  <a href="https://cpplang.slack.com/account/workspace-settings#admins">one of the admins</a>
  privately and explain the nature of the problem.
  </p></li>

</ul>

<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><b>Friendly cooperation</b></p>
  <p><em>"First, do no harm."</em></p>
  <p>Harassment, insults, discrimination,
  and cyberbullying have no place here.
  </p></li>
<li><p><b>Safe for work</b></p><p>
  Please treat all public channels as Safe For Work (SFW). Don't say
  anything you wouldn't want a co-worker to see if they pass by your desk.
  </p></li>
<li><p><b>Stay on-topic</b></p><p>
  In every public channel but especially the <b>#learn</b> channel
  which is the most heavily joined, please refrain from off-topic
  discussion. In public channels, avoid these topics altogether:
  politics, religion, race, sexual orientation.
  </p></li>
<li><p><b>No excessive self-promotion</b></p><p>
  A link to your project(s) or news item is of course welcome in the
  <b>#plug_worthy</b> channel. However keep in mind that this
  community is not intended to be an advertising platform.
  </p></li>
<li><p><b>Job offers</b></p><p>
  Job offers are welcomed in the <b>#jobs</b> channel, but please include
  the location, the company, a link to details and keep it in the relevant
  room.
  </p></li>
</ol>
